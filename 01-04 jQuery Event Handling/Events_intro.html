    <h1>jQuery Event Handling</h1>
    <div id="content">

        <p>jQuery normalizes an event structure across browsers and provides cross-browser consistency for properties such as
            the event name, the page coordinates of the mouse, the element where the event originated along with any other
            element related to the event, and information such as whether a meta-key or specific mouse button was pressed.</p>
